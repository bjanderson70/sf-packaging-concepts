Salesforce Packaging -- Foundational

# Overview
The goal here is too provide some documentation around Salesforce Packaging; especially, around 2GP. It is important to understand the architectural aspects before embarking on this journey. Salessforce Packaging **should be** a fundamental path companies move toward; but plan accordingly, and understand the path going forward. This a journey which is a fundamental paradigm shift for most organizations, so plan. Otherwise, __to package just for the sake of packaging, is doomed from the start__. It would be tantamount showing up  and climbing Mt Everest without proper planning, training and understanding of the conditions.
## Information
I have placed a number of documents in the __docs__ to hopefully provide clarity. If some of the information is unclear, click on the appropriate links to famaliarize yourself before continuing. Packaging touches a number of fundamental concepts that should not be ignored.
